            If you're anything like me, you probably liked macaroni and cheese a lot more as a kid than you do now. But alas, I've found it: the perfect macaroni and cheese for adults. Seriously, this puts Kraft to shame. Crispy golden brown cheese complete with al dente noodles drenched in gooey sauce.<br>           
            It resembles something like a casserole, but for the busy bodies out there, like me, this will be perfect for you. Set it and forget it. Then eat it. What's not to like? Scroll for recipe.<br>
            Ingredients
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb dried elbow pasta</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
                <li>2 1/2 cups half and half</li>
                <li>4 cups shredded medium cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>2 gups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 tbsp. salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp. paprika</li>
            </ul><br>
            Let's Make It!
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 9x13" baking dish</li>
    <li>Boil the pasta and cook for 7-9 minutes, not quite al dente</li>
    <li>While the pasta is cooking, mix the cheese and toss. Divide into three piles.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle flour and combine. Cook for one minute, whisking often. Slowly pour in 2 cups of the half and half and whisk until smooth. Pour in the rest of the half and half and the milk, and combine until smooth</li>
    <li>Heat over medium heat until thickened.</li>
    <li>Remove the mixture from heat and stir in spices and cheeses.</li>
    <li>Mix pasta and cheese sauce. Pour half of the pasta mix into the baking dish, then top with 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheese. On top of that, pour the remaining pasta mixture. Top with remaining cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake for 15 minutes, until cheese is golden brown. Let cool and serve.</li>
